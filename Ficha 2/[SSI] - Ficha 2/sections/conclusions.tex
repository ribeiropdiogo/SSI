\section{Conclusions}

After finishing our threat model we were able to better understand what kind of security problems may harm us in the future and what we can do to prevent that from happening. The problem that affected this system the most was the lack of a secure communication channel between all elements of the system. By implementing this, a good part of the problems that we identified can be mitigated. Some other important threats can be solved with the implementation of a proper login system with input validation methods and a module for data summaries validation.

\section{Abstract}

In this report we analysed the \emph{Precision Agriculture System} in order to create the adequate \textbf{Threat Model}. The first step was to think about what strategy we would use to identify weak points in the system. The next step consisted in creating a model of our system using a Data Flow Diagram. With that diagram and with the STRIDE approach we managed to identify several threats to our system, finishing our threat model. We also gave some suggestions of how we would fix or mitigate some of the issues we encounter.

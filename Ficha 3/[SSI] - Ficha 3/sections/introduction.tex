\section{Abstract}

In this report we were given three different IP addresses, 137.74.187.100, 45.33.32.156 and 216.58.215.148, these were used as targets. The main objective proposed was to perform Footprinting on these targets using different tools while documenting what we found. With this tactic we will be able to know who these targets are and get information useful for Penetration Testing.

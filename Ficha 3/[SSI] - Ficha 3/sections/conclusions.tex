\section{Conclusions}

After performing Footprinting on all of our targets, we were able to extract a lot of sensitive and specific information. From physical information to software versions, every single detail that we got our hands on, could also be used by an attacker to launch an attack.
With this report we gained a new insight about the exposure of systems connected to the internet and the dangers of not securing sensitive information.

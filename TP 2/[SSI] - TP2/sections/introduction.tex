\section{Abstract}

In this report we were given two groups of questions: A and B. In the first group we chose 2 companies and tried to discover as much sensible information as we could using different approaches, while trying to highlight the differences between the companies. In the second group we performed a vulnerability scan on a vulnerable host while having an IDS monitoring traffic. We analyzed the vulnerabilities found, as well as IDS alerts, and tried to implement possible fixes.

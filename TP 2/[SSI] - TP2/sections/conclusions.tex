\section{Conclusions}

With part A we discovered how different security postures can affect a real product of a company and we discovered some of the different approaches taken by companies of different sizes. With part B we gained some technical insights about Vulnerability Scanners and IDS. With these tools we gained an insight about what these tools are capable of in comparison to performing manual searches for vulnerabilities. Another aspect we learned was the differences between an IDS and a Vulnerability Scanner, as well as how to fix the Vulnerabilities on a system.

\section{Analysis}

In this chapter we are going to apply different strategies in order to find security threats and vulnerabilities that this system may be exposed to. We are going to analyze each component of this system so that we can reduce complexity and use different strategies, since each component is independent. In our analysis we will also try to suggest possible solutions to mitigate problems.

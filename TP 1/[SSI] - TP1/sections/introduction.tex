\section{Abstract}

In this report we analysed the \emph{mID} in order to search for vulnerabilities that may affect it's operation. To do so, we used a mix of different strategies including Threat Modelling, Risk Analysis and CVE. We also included some suggestions to fix or mitigate the problems we listed. Given the constraints related to resources and time, we also specified which problems should be addressed first.

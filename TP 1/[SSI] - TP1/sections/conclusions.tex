\section{Conclusions}

After analyzing each of the three entities of our system and applying our strategies in order to find vulnerabilities, we were able to list them and use a Risk Analysis to see which of these vulnerabilities should be addressed first.
With this analysis we were able to understand the amount of problems existing in a complex system, and the amount of effort required to solved them. We also learned that it is almost impossible to fix every single vulnerability or security issue that we found because they are so many and some of them depend on the software we use. The best we can do is to understand the problems that exist and try to implement measures that mitigate them and have good practices/security measures.
